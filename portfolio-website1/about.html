                    <p> Hi there! My name is Jash Singh, and I'm a UX designer that is starting out in the field.
                        I'm passionate about creating beautiful, user-centered designs that help businesses achieve
                        their goals and improve the lives of their customers.
                        My educational background is in Psychology and Chemistry. My professional experience lies in
                        being an Office Assistant and Student Advocate in the Center for Student Cultural Diversity and
                        Inclusion of my College, a caregiver, and currently an Area Manager at Amazon.
                        My design philosophy centers around putting the user first. I believe that the best designs are
                        those that are intuitive, accessible, and delightful to use. To achieve this, I use a range of tools
                        and techniques, including Figma, Framer, User Centered Design, wireframing, prototyping,
                        usability testing, preference testing, user interviews, and card sorting to gather insights.
                        One of my strengths as a professional is my ability to collaborate effectively with other
                        stakeholders, having a broad spectrum of cultural awareness gained through living in 4 different
                        countries. I understand the importance of clear communication and stakeholder buy-in when it
                        comes to creating successful products and experiences, while also creating products that are
                        accessible for all.
                        When I'm not designing, you can find me going on a jog, hiking, spending time with horses or
                        researching new topics to could learn.
                        If you're interested in working together or have any questions, feel free to get in touch with me.
                        I'm always excited to meet new people and take on new challenges. Thanks for stopping by!
